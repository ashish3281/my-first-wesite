A parallax website includes fixed images in the background that you can keep in place and you can scroll down the page to see different parts of the image.
<br>With basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, you can give a parallax effect to a website. 

Give it a try and divide the whole page into three to four different sections. 
<br>Set 3-4 background images, align the text for different sections, set margin and padding, add background-position and other CSS elements and properties to create a parallax effect.
